# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The FreeQwenImage AI Tools Platform Unification feature aims to transform the existing image enhancement tool into a comprehensive AI tools collection platform. This platform will provide a unified user experience for multiple AI-powered tools including text-to-image generation, image-to-image transformation, image enhancement, and image-to-video conversion. The goal is to create a scalable, maintainable platform that can easily accommodate new AI tools while preserving existing functionality and ensuring zero downtime during the transition.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access all AI tools from a centralized platform, so that I can easily discover and switch between different AI capabilities without navigating to separate applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the platform THEN the system SHALL display a unified AI tools collection page at `/ai-tools`
2. WHEN a user views the tools collection THEN the system SHALL show all available tools (text-to-image, image-to-image, image enhancement, image-to-video) with clear descriptions and visual indicators
3. WHEN a user clicks on any tool card THEN the system SHALL navigate to the specific tool page with consistent UI/UX patterns
4. WHEN a user is on any tool page THEN the system SHALL provide navigation to other tools through a unified navigation component

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to generate images from text descriptions, so that I can create visual content based on my written ideas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the text-to-image tool THEN the system SHALL provide a text input interface for prompt entry
2. WHEN a user submits a text prompt THEN the system SHALL call the RunningHub API with node_id=1 and return generated images
3. WHEN image generation is in progress THEN the system SHALL display real-time status updates and progress indicators
4. WHEN generation is complete THEN the system SHALL display the generated images with download and sharing options
5. IF the API request fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and retry options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to transform existing images using AI, so that I can modify and enhance my visual content with different styles and effects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the image-to-image tool THEN the system SHALL provide image upload functionality and prompt input
2. WHEN a user uploads an image and submits a transformation prompt THEN the system SHALL call the RunningHub API with node_id=3
3. WHEN transformation is processing THEN the system SHALL show progress status and estimated completion time
4. WHEN transformation is complete THEN the system SHALL display before/after comparison with download options
5. IF the uploaded image format is unsupported THEN the system SHALL display format requirements and conversion suggestions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to enhance image quality and resolution, so that I can improve the visual quality of my existing images.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the image enhancer tool THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality without disruption
2. WHEN a user uploads an image for enhancement THEN the system SHALL use the existing RunningHub API endpoints
3. WHEN enhancement is processing THEN the system SHALL display the same progress indicators as the current implementation
4. WHEN enhancement is complete THEN the system SHALL provide the same download and comparison features
5. IF a user accesses the old image enhancer URL THEN the system SHALL redirect to the new unified platform location

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to convert static images into videos, so that I can create dynamic content from my still images.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the image-to-video tool THEN the system SHALL provide image upload and video generation options
2. WHEN a user submits an image for video conversion THEN the system SHALL call the RunningHub API with node_id=4
3. WHEN video generation is processing THEN the system SHALL display progress updates and estimated completion time
4. WHEN video generation is complete THEN the system SHALL provide video preview and download functionality
5. IF video generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and troubleshooting guidance

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a unified API structure for all AI tools, so that I can maintain consistent error handling, response formats, and integration patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any AI tool makes an API request THEN the system SHALL use standardized request/response formats across all endpoints
2. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL return consistent error structures with appropriate HTTP status codes
3. WHEN API requests are processing THEN the system SHALL provide uniform status polling mechanisms
4. WHEN new tools are added THEN the system SHALL follow the established API patterns and conventions
5. IF API configuration changes THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility for existing integrations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a site administrator, I want to easily add new AI tools to the platform, so that I can expand the platform's capabilities without major architectural changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new tool is added THEN the system SHALL follow standardized configuration patterns defined in `src/config/tools.ts`
2. WHEN tool configurations are updated THEN the system SHALL automatically reflect changes in the tools collection page
3. WHEN new API endpoints are created THEN the system SHALL follow the established routing patterns under `/api/runninghubAPI/`
4. WHEN new tool pages are created THEN the system SHALL use consistent page templates and component structures
5. IF tool configurations are invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear validation errors and configuration guidance

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the platform to work seamlessly on mobile devices, so that I can use AI tools on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the platform on mobile THEN the system SHALL display responsive layouts optimized for touch interaction
2. WHEN a user uploads images on mobile THEN the system SHALL support camera capture and gallery selection
3. WHEN processing occurs on mobile THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states that don't block the interface
4. WHEN results are displayed on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide touch-friendly download and sharing options
5. IF network connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL provide offline-friendly features and retry mechanisms

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast and reliable performance across all tools, so that I can efficiently complete my AI-powered tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates between tools THEN the system SHALL load pages within 2 seconds on standard connections
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL implement proper timeout handling and retry logic
3. WHEN multiple users access the platform THEN the system SHALL maintain performance under concurrent load
4. WHEN large files are processed THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators and allow background processing
5. IF system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade performance while maintaining functionality
